      <p>Integrate your own IPTV provider in to v5 now   </p>
    </div>

  <div class="editingwindow">
    <p><strong>Do you have your own IPTV provider?</strong></p>
    <p>This huge advanced upgrade will now take your IPTV providers IPTV playlist and embed it in to your v5 software. No matter who they are we can now <strong>embed your custom IPTV provider in to V5</strong> easily.</p>
    <p>The differences with embedding it in to v5 rather than using either Kodi or a thrid party app to play the content are huge. Some testing clients have already started using this method and have seen <strong>a HUGE increase in sales </strong>and customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Take  in app payments</strong> <br />
    <span class="tiny">So users can easily buy or renew subscriptions. This will increase your revenue dramatically</span></p>
    <p> <strong>Activate users access from the Appy Zone</strong><br />
      <span class="tiny">No more sending usernames and passwords. Find the user in the appy zone and activate their device remotely. </span><br />
      </p>
    <p><strong>Use your own channel images</strong> <br />
      <span class="tiny">Rather than the ones supplied in the playlist which usually are incomplete or just not very professional.</span></p>
    <p><strong> Movies and TV Shows API</strong> <br />
      <span class="tiny">We have our own API that will take your on demand content from your playlist and organise it in to genre, attach the correct poster image and add a description to the media for your users to read. The API will download your playlist every 48 hours and automatically add new content to your app.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Add your TV guide</strong><br />
    <span class="tiny">Just add the URL to your TV guide and your live channels will display the TV guide in your software.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Simple for your user to use</strong><br />
    <span class="tiny">V5 is the future of Android TV, there is no doubt about it. Why use a seconardy product to deliver your content when you can display it and play it right from your v5 software. </span></p>
    <p><strong>You are in control</strong><br />
      <span class="tiny">Over the look and layout of the content. No longer will you have to be hostage to a poor thrid party app or use Kodi to deliver your paid content. Give your users something better and they will keep on coming back to you.</span></p>
    <p align="center">As soon as you have paid your development fee to allow your custom IPTV provider you will have unlocked access to the new IPTV options. While you start creating your images we will develop your software to allow the new feature and send it you as soon as we are done.</p>
